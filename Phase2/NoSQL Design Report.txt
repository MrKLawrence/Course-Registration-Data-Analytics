EXCLUSION	COMP 4331, ISOM 3360, RMBI 4310
DESCRIPTION	This course teaches concepts and tools for exploring and visualizing data. There are a lot of real-life decision-making problems (e.g., business, logistics, economics, marketing, finance, resource management, forecasting and engineering) which can be formulated using some existing data analysis models. Existing computer science tools such as Microsoft Excel can help us to model and solve these problems easily, and to visualize the solutions.

PRE-REQUISITE	COMP 4211 OR COMP 4331 OR ISOM 3360
CO-LIST WITH	RMBI 4310
DESCRIPTION	This course will expose students to new and practical issues of real world mining and managing big data. Data mining and management is to effectively support storage, retrieval, and extracting implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. This course will place emphasis on two parts. The first part is big data issues such as mining and managing on distributed data, sampling on big data and using some cloud computing techniques on big data. The second part is applications of the techniques learnt on areas such as business intelligence, science and engineering, which aims to uncover facts and patterns in large volumes of data for decision support. This course builds on basic knowledge gained in the introductory data-mining course, and explores how to more effectively mine and manage large volumes of real-world data and to tap into large quantities of data. Working on real world data sets, students will experience all steps of a data-mining and management project, beginning with problem definition and data selection, and continuing through data management, data exploration, data transformation, sampling, portioning, modeling, and assessment.

iii. the NoSQL query script (with explanation)
There are two NoSQL query script for the 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 function

5.3.1 Course Search by Keyword
keyword = "Visualizing"

For example, we want to find a course which is about "Visualizing". 
We sreach the keyword "Visualizing" in course titles ("cname"), course description ("listOfSections.remarks") and course remarks("courseInfo.description").
If the keyword occurs in any one of the searching result, the course will be found.
After that the list of Sections are unwinded and sort according to the Course Code ("cid") and then its Sections ("listOfSections.section").
Finally, for each course, it print out "Course Code", "Course Title”, "No. of Units/Credits", "Section", "Date & Time", "Quota", "Enrol", "Avail" and "Wait".


Query: 
db.course.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            $or:[
                {"cname": {$regex: /Visualizing/}},
                {"listOfSections.remarks": {$regex: /Visualizing/}},
                {"courseInfo.description": {$regex: /Visualizing/}}
            ]
        }
    },
    { 
        $unwind: '$listOfSections' 
    },
    {
        $sort: {cid:1, "listOfSections.section":1}
    },
    {
        $project: {_id:0,cid:1,cname:1,numberOfCredits:1,"listOfSections.section":1, "listOfSections.dateTime":1,"listOfSections.quota":1,"listOfSections.enrol":1,"listOfSections.avail":1,"listOfSections.wait":1,}
    }


5.3.2 Course Search by Waiting List Size
A non-negative real number f: 2
Starting Time Slot (start_ts): "2018-01-26T09:00:00Z"
Ending Time Slot (end_ts): "2018-02-15T00:30:00Z"

We compare the recorded timing of courses with Starting Time Slot and Ending Time Slot. 
In this query, it will find out all the courses which are recorded between the 2018-01-26 09:00:00 and 2018-02-15 00:30:00.
Then, it sorts according to the Course Code ("cid").
After that, it print out "Course Code", "Course Title”, "No. of Units/Credits", "Section", "Date & Time", "Quota", "Enrol", "Avail" and "Wait" for each course.
For the result of "Satisfied”, it will be print out after future computation.

db.course.aggregate([
    { 
        $match: {"timeRecorded" : {"$gte": ISODate("2018-01-26T09:00:00Z")},
                "timeRecorded" : {"$lte": ISODate("2018-02-15T00:30:00Z")} 
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {_id:0,cid:1,cname:1,numberOfCredits:1,"listOfSections.section":1, "listOfSections.dateTime":1,"listOfSections.quota":1,"listOfSections.enrol":1,"listOfSections.avail":1,"listOfSections.wait":1,timeRecorded:1}
    },
    {
        $sort: {cid:1}
    }
])
